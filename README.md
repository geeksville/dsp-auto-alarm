# AutoAlarm

This is a small mod for Dyson Sphere Program.

It has only a few features (and no UI other than optional config file based options):

* On a per building type basis (smelter, assembler, missle launcher, etc...) set "Alarm On" to be true/false based on config file options.  Default to true for extractors/weapons and false for everything else.
* If copying a building, also copy the alarm on/off selection.

Has anyone already done this?  Seem useful?  For my personal playstyle I've been wanting it.
